Fragility curves are used in earthquake engineering to describe the probability that a given structural system will exceed a particular damage state under specific ground motion intensity. Deriving a fragility curve involves several steps, including creating a linear regression model. Here is a simplified description of the process:

1. **Data Collection**: First, you need data from either experimental testing, past earthquake records, or structural analysis models. The key parameters include the ground motion intensity measure (IM) and the structural response or demand parameter (DP). 

2. **Perform Incremental Dynamic Analysis (IDA)**: In this step, a structural model is subjected to a series of ground motion records, each scaled to multiple intensity levels. The aim is to determine the onset of various limit states, indicating when the structure will likely suffer different levels of damage under seismic loading. **one sample data is provided for the User to try the Plotter - IDA Application.**

3. **Logarithmic Transformation**: In most cases, the relationship between the IM and DP is not linear. Therefore, a common practice is to transform the parameters using a natural logarithm, which can linearize the relationship and stabilize the variance.

4. **Linear Regression**: With the transformed data, perform a linear regression analysis to derive the relationship between the natural log of the IM and the natural log of the DP. The slope and intercept from the regression analysis are crucial, as they define the mean and standard deviation of the lognormal cumulative distribution function, which forms the basis of the fragility curve.

5. **Fragility Curve Generation**: A cumulative lognormal distribution function can be created using the parameters obtained from the linear regression. This function represents the fragility curve, which gives the probability of exceeding a specific damage state for a given ground motion intensity.

Remember, generating fragility curves involves a good understanding of the underlying physics and statistics and the limitations and assumptions associated with the process. The Application is designed to facilitate this process, providing an intuitive interface for data input, analysis, and visualization.
